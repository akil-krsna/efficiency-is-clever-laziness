# E.I.C.L (Efficiency is clever laziness)

## Introduction

It is a command line application and a library that can be used to test the efficiency of a computer. It gives a score which bases the performance per watt of the computer. The score is used as a diagnostic tool to determine whether the efficiency of a computer on reducing voltage or overclocking is increasing.

## Future Scope

- Database integration to have a centralized store of average efficiency of a given computer component
- An interactive GUI for regular users
- BIOS Level tweaks and auto optimization of parameters
- Introducing I/O, Memory, HTTP Request, and other benchmarks replicating various loads that servers regularly see
