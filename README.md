## E.I.C.L -- Efficiency Is Clever Laziness

Developed as a part of **Hexathon's Hackathon** for environmental sustainability, this command line application and library is used to benchmark the efficiency of a computer by providing a score which bases the performance per watt of servers and computers, thereby ranking different systems on efficiency. 

The **benchmarking module** consists of **CPU and GPU benchmarking** alongside a **power monitoring module**. The score is used as a diagnostic tool to determine whether the efficiency of a computer on reducing voltage or overclocking is increasing.
